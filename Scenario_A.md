Hi Patricia,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your situation with us. We hope for your fast recovery.

Per ouur attendance policy, we allow an excused absence due to an injury with appropriate documentation. For us to approve this, please submit an official medical document verifying your injury.You may send it to us at your convenience.

Once we receive the documentation, we will update your attendance accordingly.
In the meantime, we recommend reviewing the recorded lectures and slides to ensure that you don't fall behind.

I also wanted to remind you that this will be your second absence.Our policy permits three excused absences;additional absences will result in withdrawal. To prevent dismissal, make sure to attend our future classes.

If you have any questions or further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.


Best,
