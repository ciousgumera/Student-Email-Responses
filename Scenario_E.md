title: Student is Unable to Join the Zoom Session

---

Hi Roque,

Thanks for reaching out! We're sorry you're having trouble joining the session. 

Here are a few troubleshooting steps that usually fix the issue:
* Verify if you're using the correct attendance URL for your section
*  Try clearing your browser's cache and cookies, then try accessing the link again.
* Make sure you're logged into your student **Zoom account**, not a personal one.
* Make sure your Zoom application is updated to the latest version.

If you're still unable to get into the session after trying these steps, please let us know. We can then provide you with the direct Zoom link. We hope this helps you get into the session.


Best,
CodePath Support
