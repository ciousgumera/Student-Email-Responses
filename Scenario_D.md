title: ' Request for a Deadline Extension'

---

Hi Michael,

Thank you for contacting us and explaining your situation.

Per our policy , your request is approved since you've provided a valid reason (laptop issue). The default extension is 1 week from the original deadline of October 7. However, as you've specifically requested an extension on a specific date, we will set your new deadline to end of day on October 12.

If you encounter further issues, you may request additional 48-hour extension, which will be automatically approved.

Please feel free to reach out if you have additional questions.

Best,
CodePath Support
