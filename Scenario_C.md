Hi Alyn,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your situation. We understand what you are going through.

Since you have already used you two allowed 48-hour deadline extension and are requesting and extension beyond the default 48-hour period, your request will be treated as a withdrawal appeal. As per policy, your request will be considered valid and you are granted a 48-hour extension (until October 10, Friday) to submit the project.

If you find that you still need more time after this extension, please let us know. 

Thank you for your commitment to the course.

Best,
CodePath Support
